## Play
The game is really at its earliest stage, with just the basic mechanics working but you can get a sneak preview here:
[Pre-alpha](http://opherv.github.io/evolb/)

## Who and why

Evolb was designed and developed by [Opher Vishnia](http:///www.opherv.com) and [Adi Klagesbrun](http://www.dvarimshe.com/).

Evolution is a complicated concept that's very hard to grasp for some, especially because it's a complex process that occurs over such a long time span. Evolb attempts to incorporate these four pillars of evolution theory into its gameplay

**Variation:** All life forms vary genetically within a population.

**Inheritance:**
Genetic traits are inherited from parents and are passed on to offspring.

**Selection:** Organisms with traits that are favorable to their survival and reproduction are more likely to pass on their genes to the next generation.

**Time:** Evolutionary change can happen in a few generations, but major change, such as speciation, often takes many thousands of generations.

## Why open source?
Because we're big believers in sharing knowledge, especially so when it comes to sceince, the entire game and its assests are open source under GPLv2. You're more then welcome to send us your ideas, suggestions, complaints, to submit your own code or to do whatever you want with it!
